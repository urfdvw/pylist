# [1538. Card Game II](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/card-game-ii/description?_from=ladder&&fromId=92)

You are playing a card game with your friends, there are n cards in total. Each card costs cost[i] and inflicts damage[i] damage to the opponent. You have a total of totalMoney dollars and need to inflict at least totalDamage damage to win. And Each card can only be used once. Determine if you can win the game.

Example1
```
Input:
cost = [1,2,3,4,5]
damage = [1,2,3,4,5]
totalMoney = 10
totalDamage = 10

Output: true
Explanation: We can use the [1,4,5] to cause 10 damage, which costs 10.
```
Example2
```
Input:
cost = [1,2]
damage = [3,4]
totalMoney = 10
totalDamage = 10

Output: false
Explanation: We can only cause 7 damage at most.
```

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param cost: costs of all cards
    @param damage: damage of all cards
    @param totalMoney: total of money
    @param totalDamage: the damage you need to inflict
    @return: Determine if you can win the game
