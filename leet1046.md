# [1046. Last Stone Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/)

We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

 

Example 1:

    Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: 
    We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
    we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
    we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
    we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.
 

Note:

    1 <= stones.length <= 30
    1 <= stones[i] <= 1000

# Solutions
```python
from heapq import heapify, heappush, heappop
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(stones) == 0:
            return 0
        h = [-s for s in stones]
        heapify(h)
        while len(h) >= 2:
            x = -heappop(h)
            y = -heappop(h)
            remain = abs(x - y)
            heappush(h, -remain)
        return -h[0]
```
# care
- heapify has no out put, heap operations are inline
- max heap 的 负号位置
    - ```python
        h = [-s for s in stones]
        heapify(h)
        ```
    - push: `heappush(h, -x)`
    - pop:  `x = -heappop(h)`
    - peek: `-h[0]`
